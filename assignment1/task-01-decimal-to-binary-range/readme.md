\# Task 01: Decimal to Binary Range Converter



\## ğŸ§  Problem Description



This program accepts multiple integers as input and for each integer `n`, it converts all decimal numbers from 0 up to `n` (inclusive) into their binary representations.



Each test case outputs the space-separated binary numbers from 0 to `n`.



\## ğŸš€ How It Works



1\. The program asks how many test cases you want to run.

2\. For each test case, you input a decimal number.

3\. The script converts every number in the range `\[0, n]` to binary using integer division.

4\. It prints the binary values in a single line for each test case.



\## ğŸ“¦ Example



\*\*Input:\*\*

Enter test case count: 2

Enter decimal integers: 3

Enter decimal integers: 5



\*\*Output:\*\*

0 1 10 11

0 1 10 11 100 101
